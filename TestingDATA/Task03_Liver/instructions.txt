Under this Task03_liver directory :
1) download and unzip the training data, testing data and labels for data processing
2) create a folder named dicom_files which contains 2 more folder: images and labels.
3) Run the extract_archives.py first for the training data(which'll be stored
    in  a directory named imagesTr) output in dicom_files/images
    and then for labels(in labelsTr) output in dicom_files/labels
This step ensures that the .nii(nifti files) have been converted into the corresponding 
number of .dcom(dicom series) = slices of that MRI scan
